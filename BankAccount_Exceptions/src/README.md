# Bank Account Program

This is a simple program that simulates a bank account. It allows you to read account data and perform a withdrawal, validating if the balance is sufficient and if the withdrawal amount does not exceed the account's withdrawal limit.
For implementation, exceptions and treatment resources were used.

## Features

- **Exception handling**
- **Read Bank Account Data**: The program allows you to input the account number, initial balance, and withdrawal limit.
- **Make a Withdrawal**: After reading the account data, you can make a withdrawal, with the following validations:
  - Withdrawal cannot be made if there is insufficient balance.
  - The withdrawal amount cannot exceed the withdrawal limit of the account.
- **Display New Balance**: After the withdrawal, the program shows the new account balance.
